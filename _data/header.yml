description: |
   The Solidity team is organizing a language summit in Berlin to gather people involved and interested in the Solidity language, 
   the ecosystem and tooling around it. The intent is to have useful discussions that result in improvement proposals leading to actual implementations.
   In particular, this event should help increase the amount of communication between teams working on similar 
   topics or on topics that build on top of each other and identify needs for the smart contract ecosystem for Ethereum.
