 - title: PARTICIPATE ONLINE
   text:
    <p>The summit is powered by Interspace.Chat. Interspace is a virtual meeting infrastructure based on self-hosted 
    Jitsi video chat rooms. <br> <br>
    There are two options how you’ll be able to participate during the summit: <br>
1. Join the Jitsi video conference. <br>
2. Watch the livestream. <br> <br>
Unless you actively want to participate/talk/present during the respective session, we recommend using the livestream option 
to ensure a smooth experience for everyone and save your CPU. <br>
Once live, the link to the Solidity Summit's Interspace portal will be added to this website. The portal will include all 
relevant links (chat, livestream, video conference, agenda) in one place.
