 - title: SUMMIT
   text:
    <p>Do you have a change proposal for the Solidity language? Are you using a language feature in a novel way that might benefit others?
    Do you want to build a debugger but are missing information from the compiler?
    Are you working with Solidity on a day-to-day basis and just want to hang out with similar-minded people?
    Then this event is for you!</p>
    <p>If you want to participate - either as a visitor or presenter - fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SMJa_ezfNLGNzBB4YLdQXn5Jk-b4RsUSuJdj5KbbYhU">application form</a>.</p>
