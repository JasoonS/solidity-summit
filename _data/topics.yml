 - title: UPDATE
   text:
    <p>Given the recent developments in connection with the corona virus, as a precautionary measure,
    the Solidity Summit will <b>not</b> happen as planned. Instead, we will transform it into an online event on the same days.
    Please stay tuned for updates!</p>
 - title: SUMMIT
   text:
    <p>Do you have a change proposal for the Solidity language? Are you using a language feature in a novel way that might benefit others?
    Do you want to build a debugger but are missing information from the compiler?
    Are you working with Solidity on a day-to-day basis and just want to hang out with similar-minded people?
    Then this event is for you!</p>
    <p>If you want to participate - either as a visitor or presenter - fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SMJa_ezfNLGNzBB4YLdQXn5Jk-b4RsUSuJdj5KbbYhU">application form</a>.
    Please submit talk applications by the end of February!</p>
    <p>Ticket prices are still to be determined, but proceeds from ticket sales will only be used to cover venue and production costs.
    Limited number of scholarships for students and discounted tickets will also be available, please get in touch with us by email!</p>
